# Contributing to Multi-Agent AI Bidding Simulator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Multi-Agent AI Bidding Simulator! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git for version control
- OpenAI API key (for full functionality)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RounitR/Multi-Agent-AI-Bidding-System.git
cd multi_agent_ai_simulator

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv_py39
source venv_py39/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_py39\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Run the application
streamlit run frontend/enhanced_app.py
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Include tests for new functionality

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run the enhanced system tests
python test_enhanced_system.py

# Test OpenAI integration
python test_openai.py

# Run the application locally
streamlit run frontend/enhanced_app.py
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of changes"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes

### Example Code Style
```python
def calculate_optimal_bid(
    market_threshold: float,
    cost_price: float,
    competitor_bids: List[float]
) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Calculate the optimal bid based on market conditions.
    
    Args:
        market_threshold: Maximum acceptable bid
        cost_price: Minimum viable bid
        competitor_bids: List of competitor bid amounts
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (optimal_bid, confidence_score)
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Frontend Code (Streamlit)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize components logically
- Add appropriate error handling
- Ensure responsive design

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain good test coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Test with different data scenarios

### Example Test Structure
```python
def test_enhanced_bidding_agent():
    """Test enhanced bidding agent functionality."""
    agent = EnhancedBiddingAgent("test_agent", "balanced")
    
    # Test bid generation
    bid = agent.generate_bid(1000, 500, [800, 900, 950])
    assert 500 <= bid <= 1000
    
    # Test learning
    agent.update_reward(state, action, True, 950)
    assert agent.total_reward > 0
```

## Documentation Guidelines
